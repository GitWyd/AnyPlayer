# Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Browser and Flash Games (ARLF-BFG)

## Description
ARLF-BFG is a Python-based reinforcement learning framework designed for automating and learning from browser and flash games. It uniquely integrates user demonstrations, OCR, and custom-configurable reward functions for a versatile learning environment.

## Key Features
1. **Game Compatibility**: Supports various browser and flash games, configurable via JSON/YAML files.
2. **User Demonstration Interface**: Allows gameplay demonstration for strategy learning.
3. **Dynamic Screen Analysis**: Uses OCR for in-game feedback (scores, lives, currency) from user-defined regions.
4. **Customizable Reward Function**: Assign weights to in-game metrics in config files.
5. **Continuous Learning Approach**: Handles non-stepwise, continuous game environments.
6. **Extensibility and Scalability**: Easily adaptable to new games and updates.
7. **Robust Learning Algorithms**: Suitable for environments with delayed rewards.
8. **User-Friendly Setup**: Streamlined game setup and learning progress monitoring.

## Usage Scenarios
- Automating gameplay in browser or flash games.
- AI and machine learning research in varied environments.
- Development experiments with OCR in reinforcement learning.
