# Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Browser and Flash Games (ARLF-BFG)

## Description:
ARLF-BFG is an innovative, Python-based reinforcement learning framework designed to automate and learn from a variety of browser and flash games. It uniquely integrates user demonstrations, optical character recognition (OCR), and custom-configurable reward functions to create a versatile and adaptive learning environment.

## Key Features:

Game Compatibility: Supports a wide range of browser and flash games, easily configurable through JSON or YAML files.
User Demonstration Interface: Allows users to demonstrate gameplay, enabling the framework to learn and mimic human strategies.
Dynamic Screen Analysis: Utilizes OCR to read in-game quantitative feedback such as scores, lives, and currency from user-defined screen regions.
Customizable Reward Function: Config files allow users to assign weights to various in-game metrics, tailoring the learning process to specific game dynamics.
Continuous Learning Approach: Designed to handle non-stepwise, continuous game environments, learning over rounds or specific in-game sequences.
Extensibility and Scalability: Flexible architecture to add new games and adapt to game updates.
Robust Learning Algorithms: Incorporates advanced reinforcement learning algorithms suited for environments with delayed rewards.
User-Friendly Setup: Streamlined process for setting up new games and monitoring the learning progress.
Usage Scenarios:

Game enthusiasts looking to automate gameplay in their favorite browser or flash games.
Researchers in AI and machine learning exploring reinforcement learning in varied and unpredictable environments.
Developers experimenting with integrating OCR into reinforcement learning frameworks.
